# Post-model and intra-model debiasing scripts
Each of the three folders contains clearly labeled scripts for running different debiasing methods featured in the work. The codebases are adjusted to support LTG-BERT and LTG-Baseline experiments.

- **ase:** Contains code for running the debiasing loss experiment
- **bec:** Contains code for running the CDS experiment
- **bias-bench:** Contains code for running the Sent-Debias, INLP, CDA, and Dropout experiments
